# SAST-Image-Frontend

It used to be the frontend of SastImg.

It applies Vue3, Typescript.

It had so few developers that the rising development and maintenance costs made it almost impossible to continue in previous model of front-back-ends seperation.

A continuation version of SAST-Image-Frontend can be seen at [SAST-Image-RE](https://github.com/NJUPT-SAST-Csharp/SAST-Image-Re), which is refactored in ASP .NET Core.
